# Portfolio
A brief introduction 

Project Title:
About Me Portfolio, this project is to introduce myself and show off some of my work. This webpage is compatible with desktop sized screens along with cellphone sized screens. I'm just getting started so more will be added soon. 

Reason:
I want to get my name out there in the coding world. Show off what I can do with my own website and see if I can push my own limits with that.

Code:
I am using Bootstrap, Html and CSS to create this.

Future Developement:
I plan to fix the photos on the portfolio page.
Add a better description of who I am and what my goals are for coding.
Add coding work in the place of the photos.
